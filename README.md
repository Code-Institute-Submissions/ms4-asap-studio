## UX

The ASAP Studio website provides the means for users to have all the audio, video and other
technical equipment that is needed for creating podcasts, streaming, film making, Youtube content,
music producing etc. All of that without having to spent tons of money to buy the equipment and 
build their own studio but instead just use it for as long as it is needed.
