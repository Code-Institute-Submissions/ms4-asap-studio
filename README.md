# ASAP Studio

<!-- ASAP Studio Live Link! -->

ASAP Studio is a business e-commerce type of website that provides specific services to 
clients such as loaning out special equipment or booking studio time to complete their
work, project, hobby or study goals in the desired style and quality.

## UX

The ASAP Studio website provides the means for users to have all the audio, video and other
technical equipment that is needed for creating podcasts, streaming, film making, Youtube content,
music producing etc. All of that without having to spent tons of money to buy the equipment but 
instead just use it for as long as it is needed. Including the option to book a studio makes it 
easier to get to the user's final goal ASAP(as soon as possible).
